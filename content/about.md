Hi, my name is Houman

I’m a Network Engineer and tech enthusiast.
I'm learning how to code in Python and increasing my knowledge of Cloud and Security technologies.

I’ll be writing things I'm learning about or working on, aswell as my other antics.

I am an avid Scuba Diver and enjoy being immersed in nature.

I’ve grown up in Melbourne, Australia and currently live abroad.
