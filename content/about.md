Hi, my name is Houman

I’m a Network Engineer and Tech enthusiast.
I'm learning how to code in Python and enjoy learning about Cloud and Security Technologies.

I’ll be writing about what I'm working on and my other antics, feel free to have a read or even leave a comment.

I am an avid Scuba Diver and enjoy many outdoor activities.

I grew up in Melbourne, Australia, and currently I live abroad.

Welcome
