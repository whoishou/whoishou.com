Welcome to my Home Lab

This is where I ~~break~~ learn new things as well as host a few services that I use.  
It’s still a work in progress but I’ve got the network topology down and how I’d like it to be setup.

Currently I’m working on learning more about Firewalls, IDS, IPS and SIEMs as well as general sysadmin work and automating deployments.

An Open VPN servers is in the pipelines so I can access the lab remotely, as well as being able to share a few of the services with colleagues and friends.

Ideally I’d like to reach a stage where I can begin automating different elements of the lab and exploring offsite cloud services.

I’ll be making ~~regular~~ blog posts on my progress, so feel free to head over to read more
