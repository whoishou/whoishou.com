Recently, I completed my PADI Open Water and Advanced Open Water certifications, it was an incredible experience. I have been wanting to learn how to scuba dive for a long time and finally, I made it happen.

The Open Water certification involved learning the basics of scuba diving, including how to use the equipment, dive planning, and basic dive skills. One of the challenging aspects of the course was learning how to clear water out of my mask and regulator while underwater. It was also a bit cold and windy during my Open Water dives, which made it a bit more challenging, but it was worth it in the end.

Once I completed my Open Water certification, I decided to take the next step and do the Advanced Open Water certification. The Advanced Open Water certification is a great way to build on the skills and knowledge I acquired during my Open Water certification. It covered more advanced dive skills and techniques, such as deep diving, navigation, and buoyancy.

One of the most significant differences between the Open Water and Advanced Open Water certifications is the depth at which you can dive. During the Advanced Open Water course, I was able to dive to a maximum depth of 30 meters, which was a new and exciting experience for me. I also learned how to navigate using a compass, which was a new skill for me.

The Advanced Open Water certification also involved doing five different dives, each focusing on a specific skill. I did a deep dive, a navigation dive, a buoyancy dive, a wreck dive and a fish identification dive. Each dive was unique and taught me new skills and techniques.

Overall, completing my PADI Open Water and Advanced Open Water certifications was an incredible experience. I learned so much and gained a new appreciation for the underwater world. I am now a certified diver and can't wait to explore the many beautiful dive sites around the world.
