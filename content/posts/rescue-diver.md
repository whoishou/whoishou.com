In November, I was travelling back home to Melbourne and took the opportunity to get certified with Ocean Divers as a PADI Rescue Diver. Having already completed my Open and Advanced Open Water certifications, it was the next step for further progression as a Recreational Diver.

It was an experience that I will never forget. It was both challenging and rewarding, and it has changed the way I approach diving.

The course covered a wide range of topics, including self-rescue, recognizing and managing stress in other divers, emergency management and equipment, and rescuing panicked divers. I learned how to assess a situation and make quick, effective decisions to ensure the safety of myself and others. 
The course also certified me as an Emergency First Responder covering Primary & Secondary Care with AED usage.

One of the most important skills I learned as a PADI Rescue Diver was how to identify and manage stress in myself and other divers. Stress can have a major impact on a diver's ability to think and act clearly in an emergency situation, so it's essential to learn how to recognize and manage it. This included understanding the signs and symptoms of stress, as well as how to create a safe and supportive diving environment.

I also learned about emergency management and equipment, including how to use a diver-carried CPR mask to administer rescue breaths and how to administer oxygen to a diver in distress. I learned how to conduct a search and rescue operation, as well as how to manage a diver who is unconscious or unresponsive.

One of the most rewarding aspects of becoming a PADI Rescue Diver was the opportunity to put my newfound knowledge into practice. The course included a number of rescue scenarios, where I had the opportunity to practice what I had learned. This hands-on experience was invaluable, as it helped me to develop the confidence and skills I needed to handle a real-life emergency situation.

In addition to the technical skills, the PADI Rescue Diver course also focused on leadership and teamwork. As a rescue diver, I am in a position of responsibility, and I need to be able to lead and inspire others in an emergency situation. The course helped me develop the leadership skills I need to be an effective leader, both above and below the water.

Overall, becoming a PADI Rescue Diver was an amazing experience. It's an opportunity to develop new skills, build confidence and become a more responsible and safety-conscious diver. I learned how to help others and become an expert in safety and leadership. It's a course that has changed the way I dive and gave me the confidence and skills I need to handle any emergency situation.
