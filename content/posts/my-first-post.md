Hi, my name is Houman

I’m a tech enthusiast, aspiring to build a career in Information Security.

I’ll be sharing posts about my antics over on my blog; about my home lab, what I’m working on and learning about currently and from time to time, random things that peak my interest.

I’ve grown up in Melbourne, Australia and currently live abroad.

If you would like to get in touch, send me a message on Twitter, LinkedIn or an email at houman@whoishou.com
