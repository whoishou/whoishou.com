You might have heard about ChatGPT making the rounds on social media, I've been telling some of my colleagues about it and their first question is always, what is it?

I figured it would be a good topic for a blog post, but rather than write a blog post about it, I figured I could just tell ChatGPT to write a blog post about itself, and it made excellent work of it. All I provided was a prompt:

*Write a blog post in markdown format about ChatGPT for both a technical and non-technical audience*

The following text was generated by ChatGP*

ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model developed by OpenAI that has the ability to generate human-like text based on a given prompt. This technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of conversational AI, making it easier for businesses and organizations to create natural and seamless interactions with their customers and clients.

# How it works
ChatGPT is a powerful tool that can be used to create chatbots, virtual assistants, and other conversational interfaces that can understand and respond to human language. With ChatGPT, businesses can create chatbots that can answer customer questions, provide product information, and even complete transactions. This technology can also be used to create virtual assistants that can help with scheduling, email management, and other tasks.

One of the key benefits of ChatGPT is that it can be trained on a wide range of data, allowing it to understand and respond to a wide range of human language. This means that businesses can create chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand and respond to their customers in a natural and intuitive way.

# Technical Details
ChatGPT is a transformer-based language model that uses a deep learning technique called unsupervised learning. It is trained on a massive dataset of text data and fine-tuned on a smaller dataset specific to the task at hand. The model is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data, which allows it to generate highly coherent and fluent text based on a given prompt.

One of the key features of ChatGPT is its ability to generate text that is highly coherent and fluent. This is achieved through the use of a technique called "contextual embeddings," which allows the model to take into account the context of the prompt when generating text. This helps to ensure that the text generated is relevant and makes sense in the context of the prompt.

The model architecture is a variant of the transformer architecture, which is a popular choice for language modeling and has been used in many state-of-the-art models such as BERT, GPT-2 and GPT-3. The transformer architecture allows the model to handle long-term dependencies and makes it more suitable for tasks such as language generation.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, ChatGPT is a powerful language model that has the potential to revolutionize the field of conversational AI. It can be used to create chatbots and virtual assistants that can understand and respond to human language in a natural and intuitive way. The model's ability to generate coherent and fluent text, as well as its ability to handle long-term dependencies make it a popular choice for various NLP tasks.

I've been having a lot of fun testing ChatGPTs capabilities by providing it with different prompts, it's not perfect, but it's an amazing advancement, and I'm looking forward to seeing further advancements to AI in the coming decade.

What has your experience been with ChatGPT? What kind of prompts have you given it?
